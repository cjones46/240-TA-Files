## Data

We'll use the built-in `mtcars` data to review.

```{r}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars, n = 10)
```

# ggplot

`ggplot` utilizes aesthetic mappings to generalize the plotting of data to many different formats.
It is important to remember the `aes()` arguments different `geom` functions take.
For example, let's look at `geom_bar()` vs. `geom_col()`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

mtcars %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cyl))
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = cyl, y = n))
```

We get the same graph in both instances, but `geom_col()` requires a `y` argument while `geom_bar()` does not.

# dplyr

## filter

`filter()` takes a dataframe and logical statement as inputs. 
It outputs the rows where that logical statement is `TRUE`.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

filter(mtcars, cyl == 6)
```

## mutate

`mutate()` creates a new column in your dataframe.
If you assign a new variable the same name as a column already in your dataframe, that column is overwritten.

```{r}
mutate(mtcars, new_col = mpg * cyl)
```

```{r}
mutate(mtcars, new_col = "Overwrite")
```

## group_by / summarize

`group_by()` and `summarize()` are used in tandem to collapse rows of your dataframe into a summary.
The variables specified in `group_by()` uniquely group the output rows.
`summarize()` is used similarly to `mutate()` after grouping.

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

# lubridate

`lubridate` makes it easy to work with dates in R.
Use `lubridate` to turn strings that look like dates into datetime objects that can be more flexibly used.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

typeof("2023-03-06")
ymd("2023-03-06") %>% typeof()
month(ymd("2023-03-06"))
```
